Project Title: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection on System Log for Insurance Fraud in Healthcare

Overview:
This project focuses on utilizing unsupervised anomaly detection techniques to detect insurance fraud in the healthcare domain using time series data from system logs. The goal is to develop a robust anomaly detection system that can identify suspicious patterns and activities within the system logs, which may indicate fraudulent behaviour. 

Installation:	
	Prerequisites:
	- Python 3.7 or higher
	- Anaconda (optional but recommended)

Steps to set up and run the application for unsupervised anomaly detection on system log:
	Step 1: Clone the repository
	- Open a terminal or command prompt
	- Run the following command to clone the repository:
		git clone https://github.com/marinimansor/Dashboard/tree/main
	- Change the directory to the project folder using the following command:
		cd your-project

	Step 2: Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
	- It is recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. This 	step is optional but highly recommended to maintain a clean and consistent environment.
	- With Anaconda, run the following command:
		conda create --name anomaly-detection-env python=3.7
		conda activate anomaly-detection-env
	- Without Anaconda, run the following command:
		python3 -m venv anomaly-detection-env
  		source anomaly-detection-env/bin/activate

	Step 3: Install the dependencies
	- Run the following command to install the required Python packages:
		pip install -r requirements.txt

	Step 4: Prepare the data
	- Place your system log dataset (time series data) in the appropriate directory or specify 	the path to the dataset in the code.
	- Perform any necessary data preprocessing steps (e.g., cleaning, normalization, feature 	extraction) based on the specific requirements of your dataset. You may refer to the project 	documentation or code for guidance.

	Step 5: Run the application
	- Execute the main script or Jupyter Notebook file to run the unsupervised anomaly detection 	algorithm on your system log data.
	- Follow the instructions provided in the project documentation or code to configure the 	algorithm parameters, such as the choice of anomaly detection technique, hyperparameters, and 	threshold values.
	- Monitor the application output or visualize the results to identify potential anomalies or 	suspicious patterns in the system log data.
